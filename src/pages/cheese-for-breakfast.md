Matt woke up, checked himself out in the mirror, "Halloumi", and proceeded downstairs. He knew that this was going to be a momentous day, for today, he was going to have cheese for breakfast!

Whilst his long suffering girlfriend looked on aghast, a wonderful breakfast was created utilising the king of cheeses, stilton, crunchy crackers, and sweet sweet grapes. 

"THERE ARE NO RULES TO LIFE, I CAN EAT CHEESE FOR BREAKFAST IF I WANT TO!" Matt screamed at no one in particular (in this instance, no one in particular was the aforementioned long suffering girlfriend). He enjoyed the most cheese heavy breakfast of his life, and afterwards had a nap because he had just eaten copious amounts of cheese for breakfast.
